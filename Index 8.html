    <p> Since you picked the cheese, the elephant inhaled the toxic fumes of the river, and now thinks the mouse is 20 feet tall instead of about 4 inches tall. The elephant runs blindly and jumps straight into the river. Unfortunately for you, the elephant is heading rght towards you. Its butt squishes both you and the cheese on board. You have died a horrible death, and will forever be remembered as Branden, the guy who died by getting sat on by an elephant.</p>
