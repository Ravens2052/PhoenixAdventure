    <p> Sorry, unfortunately for you, the mouse got dropped into the Lake, while you are looking for the moue, it mutates into a giant mutant creature and slices your arms off. You scream and shrill in pain and agony, but no one can hear you. You slowly bleed out and start tripping balls because you have inhaled toxic fumes. Branden and you have now died.</p>
